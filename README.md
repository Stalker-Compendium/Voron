Desription:

Display the 'Voron Spawner' window when F1 key is hit in the main menu of the game.
So you will be able to spawn all the artefacts, outfits, devices, food and drugs, weapon addons, weapons, ammos and PDA infos.

This is the newest version of the Voron Spawner.
Now the dialog window stay in the main menu, so you can take your time to choose the items without risk to be killed.
The items are classified by category's, you can list them by clicking on buttons at the top of the window.   
The futur 1.3 version of this mod will contain a parser, this way, Voron will be able to spawn items from others mods.


If anyone want to participate in any way, please write me an Email.

You are welcome!

Notes:

This mod was tested with Stalker Clear Sky version 1.5.10. 
I think he should also work with past versions of the game...

_____________________________________________________________________________

Installation:

Unzip everything into your stalker Clear Sky directory. 

If you have not used mods before, you will need to open your "fsgame.ltx" file found in the "program files/thq/Stalker" directory.
Open this file with a text editor and find the following line:

$game_data$ = false| true| $fs_root$| gamedata

Change the false to true, i.e.:

$game_data$ = true| true| $fs_root$| gamedata
